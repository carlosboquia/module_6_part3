# About me

I'm a full-stack developer and cloud/DevOps/data analysis enthusiast.

I’m passionate about coordinating projects, optimizing workflows, and leading teams to achieve great results.

Currently expanding my expertise in **Python**, **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **SQL**, and cloud technologies.

Beyond coding, I bring hands-on experience as a project coordinator and support professional—managing workflows, troubleshooting operational issues, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth project delivery.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me watching movies and TV shows, gaming, following esports, or reviewing local food spots (**@reviewlos** on Instagram).
